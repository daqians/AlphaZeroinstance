# AlphaZeroinstance

This project is mainly based on the AlphaGo Zero programme. Using multi-layer self learning algorithm to train the model withoout human data's help. That mains this machine learning algorithm can train it by battling with itself. 

For this project, Alpha Zero's algorithm is using to let the model learn how to play connect four chess and meta squares. You can find the different chess standard in the game fold and change the game if you want.

# *Update：*

This update for DeeplearningPro maintain the original project and cover some bugs in the coding. The original code can not run without modifying.

This update is base on the environment: Jupter Notebook, Python 3.6, Keras API, Tensorflow API and some other necessary APIs.
